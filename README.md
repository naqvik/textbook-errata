# textbook-errata
Track errata for various textbooks.

I've been searching for a public way to track errors discovered in textbooks, such that students can freely submit their own discovered flaws and corrections.  The *wiki* feature with tables (using the markdown language) seems a fairly good solution, though a bit clunky.

Currently the books covered here include:
- Horenstein, Mark N., "Microelectronic circuits and devices", 2/e., Prentice-Hall, 1996.

Here's how to update a book if you want to add an erratum:

1. Go to the wiki page for the appropriate textbook.
2. Add a new entry in the table, filling in the appropriate values in each column.  Please insert the new entry so that the page numbers stay in ascending order.  Use the existing entries as a guide.
