# textbook-errata
Track errata for various textbooks.

I've been searching for a public way to track errors discovered in textbooks, such that students can freely submit their own discovered flaws and corrections.

Currently the books covered here include:
- Horenstein, Mark N., "Microelectronic circuits and devices", 2/e., Prentice-Hall, 1996.
