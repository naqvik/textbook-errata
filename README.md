## textbook-errata
Track errata for various textbooks.

I've been searching for a public way to track errors discovered in textbooks, such that students can freely submit their own discovered flaws and corrections.  Maintaining a table of errata for each text (using the markdown language) seems a fairly good solution, though a bit clunky.

Currently the books covered here include:
- Horenstein, Mark N., "Microelectronic circuits and devices", 2/e, Prentice-Hall, 1996.
- Yiu, Joseph, "The Definitive Guide to ARM Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 Processors", 3/e, Newnes, 2014.

Here's how to view or update errata:

1. Go to the document for the appropriate textbook.  View the table and note the errata.
2. If you want to add a _new entry_ in the table, contact me with the following information:
 * What the error is, and the page number
 * Explain how to fix the error

If you are a student currently registered in my class, and you find a previously undiscovered error in one of these textbooks, you can also:
  * Claim your prize: a book from my library.  I have a lot of technical books and texts, and I'm trying to winnow down this collection, as well as giving my extra books a good home.
