   - Please keep the rows in ascending page order, to facilitate fast
     lookup.
   - The official errata site for Joseph Yiu's series of books is
     [[https://community.arm.com/processors/b/blog/posts/errors-in-the-definitive-guide-for-arm-cortex-m-book-series][here]].  So check there before submitting an erratum report.  The
     two items on p.100 and p.108 are already present on Yiu's site,
     but they were added here before I had discovered its existence.
