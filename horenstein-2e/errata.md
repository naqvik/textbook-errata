| 30  | Q1.31:The current, I1, should be 10 mA, not -10 mA.  |   The direction of the current is already clearly indicated by the downward arrow in Fig P1.30, so making its value negative is incorrect.  | Mario  | 2016-05-29
| 33 | Q1.65(a): The resistor R_1 appears twice in the figure, once in the input circuit, and once in the output. | There appears to be no reason why the two resistors need have the same value.  We could rename the output resistor R_2.  The answer in the back on p. 1105 would then be changed to v_Th = -g v_1 R_1 R_2/(R_s + R_1), and R_Th = R2. | karim | 2018-05-15 |
| 137 | Eqn 3.46 | The resistor in the denominator of the 2nd term should be R_2, not R_s | Matthew Rostad | 2017-06-05 |
| 167 | Q3.135 Find the ac component of ... | Assume the voltage across D1 is 0.7V, and use this to calculate that across D2 | karim | 2016-08-05 |
| 224 | Q4.72: Figure P4.72 | The vOUT terminal labels are accidentally reversed in polarity in all 4 parts a-d| karim | 2017-05-25|
| 239 | Exercise 5.1 | The value of 7.3V should be changed to about 4.4V | Robin Pandher | 2017-06-22 |
| 257 | Exercise 5.32 | Answer to the 2nd part should be 50uA, not 0.5uA | karim | 2017-06-26 |
| 307 | Q5.126: Consider the circuit of Fig. P5.44 | Should read **Fig. 5.44** | Zuoxiu Xing | 2017-06-13 |
| 307 | Q5.129: A photodiode with beta_I = 0.2mA/lm | The unit "lm" has never been defined | karim | 2017-06-13 |
| 332  | 2nd line after eqn 6.46                             | Last word  on the line should be RB, not RE.        | karim     | 2016-08-02 |
| 338  | Paragraph ending "is explored in Problem 6.80" | "is explored in Problem 6.83" | karim     | 2016-08-02 |
|372      | Upper left of page, for part (d), text reads "At what value of vIN will vOUT lie midway between the two limits found in parts (a) and (b)?"  | " ... limits found in parts (b) and (c)?"                                 |   karim        | 2016-08-02           |
| 1106 | Solution to Q5.91: (a) iB=19.6 &micro;A (b) iC=0.98 mA | (a) iB=98.04 &micro;A (b) iC=4.902mA | armin | 2016-08-03|
| 1107     | Q.6.32 solution: Answers given for parts b, c, and e are incorrect: (b) vOUT=2V, (c) vOUT=3.4V, (e) not answered         | (b) vOUT=5V, (c) vOUT=1.351V, (e) Vpeak=0.395V    |  karim         |  2016-08-02          |
| 1110 | QA.29 solution: W/L = 11.7 is incorrect | W/L = 41.69 | karim | 2017-06-09 |
